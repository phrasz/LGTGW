Creating a Local or Remote Git Repo
===================================
TL;DR: Git is a P2P VCS, but you can have both local and remote repo's

Let's look at the example of how to start a project from scratch on a local machine AND how to clone an existing repo online
[Part I: Local Git Repos]
-------------------------
	###I. Git Init (Initlialize a Repo the FIRST TIME EVAR for a project...)
		0. Find a Folder to work out of
			[CL/Term] mkdir C:\My Programming\LGTGW\ <||> mkdir ~/LGTGW/
			
		1. Start a repo!
			[CL/Term] git init
			
		2. Code the following Hello World for C
			[Text Editor START]
				#include <stdio.h>

				int main(){
					printf("\nHello World!");
					return 0;
				}
			[Text Editor END] 
			==> SAVE AS: Hello.c
			
		3. Add the files to the Repo 
			[CL/Term] git add Hello.c
				OR
			[CL/Term] git add * <||> git add .
			
		4. Let's save the file to the new Repo as a commit
			[CL/Term] git commit -m "W00t! Hello World"
			
		5. Look at the Commit on Command Line/ Terminal
			[CL/Term] git status
			
		6. Look at the Commit with Gitk
			[CL/Term] gitk

	Synopsis: You make a new repo, add the C file, and then commited it for the record. Git status and Gitk will show you this history.
	
Copying repos on git 1:1 is known as cloning. You don't have to init a repo IF you clone a remote repository!	

[Part II: Remote Git Repos]
---------------------------
	###I. git clone <repo>
	0. Find some code you want to clone (Github.com for starters)
	
	1. Open up termimal; change to a generic working folder
		[CL/Term] cd c:\ <||> cd ~/
	
	2. Clone that Repo!
		[CL/Term] git clone https://github.com/phrasz/LGTGW
		
	3. Code like normal; and repeate actions like #2 above --^
	
	4. Repeat steps 4-6 from above
